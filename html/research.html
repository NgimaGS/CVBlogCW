                The website was created using the above websites as a reference. 
                I used many of the elements used in the aboves website as a templet and implemented it using css codes. 
                I couldn't  exactly replicate the effects provided by the reference website and so used other similar codes 
                with similar functions for developing the website.
                Furthermore, I looked at the documentation provided by the College and w3schools for further improving the 
                designs and effects of the website. Using the references and documentation I managaed to provide a suitable 
                website with a proper designs for the course work.

                    I used the templet of the reference site and implementedmy own templete similar to the reference

                    I tried to implement similar templete for the picture using "img" tag but couldnt propley 
                    maintain the size of the picture. So, instead created a division and assigned it as background image 
                    to the division and created the similar templet with modified style to my webpage using css codes.

                    The photo gallery was implemented by using the reference from the reference website. From the reference 
                    I simply add some extra feature like link to the image so that when clicking on the image it links to the 
                    reference webpage. I also added some extra hover effects on the images.

                    Using the reference website, a proper contact page was created. With the help of documentation provided by 
                    the W3schools I inserted other different input types and adjusted the place of text area according to my 
                    liking.
