                precise working. Machine can also work much faster than people which also helps the company to save time hence, machine are more effective than peoples. Most machinery are used in our daily life such as laptops, refrigirators, oven, T.V, etc.

                 Pointing out technology in our lives is easy. We get up and flip a switch to turn on the lights. The lights are technology and so is the switch. The power plant that generated the electricity that powers the light is also technology. You make coffee using the technology of a coffee maker. You take a shower, and water that came from miles away pours over your body.

                But how has all this really impacted society as a whole? What's the bigger picture?<br>

                Let's go back to your shower, which represent cleanliness. This is the cleanliness that didn't exist centuries ago, and barely existed one century ago. Add hygiene to medical technology, advanced pharmaceuticals, medical scanners, and machines that can breathe or beat your heart for you, and hopefully you see one major theme in how society has changed. No matter who you are, your health is bound to be hugely better than it would've been a century or two ago. Our expectations about life's longevity and what it means to be healthy are totally different now. Life expectancy across the world has been on the rise continually.
